* The State of the UUU. Where are we going?  (delcypher, 20:23:48)
  * Until very recently the UUU was pretty much dead. We hardly post on
    facebook/twitter about events, none of us attended Unicon and the
    plan BUC fell flat due our own inaction  (delcypher, 20:24:33)
  * We need to evaluate what the UUU's role actually is. Possibly
    smaller goals?  (delcypher, 20:25:22)

* BUC2015, maybe hold at BJC?  (delcypher, 20:34:45)

    (delcypher, 20:44:24)

* Abby Williams recently got in touch offering to help out the UUU
  (delcypher, 20:46:07)
  * ACTION: For now abbythesmall will join the UUU meetings and will let
    us know if anything we need doing sounds interesting to her
    (delcypher, 20:58:30)

* Vote to remove slect discipline reps (muni, trials, street, road,
  flatland, freestyle) if they aren't effective  (delcypher, 20:58:57)
  * We have a problem. We have quite a few discipline reps (we even have
    two road reps) but a few don't really contribute much and delay
    setting up meetings because they never reply to the doodle polls
    (delcypher, 20:59:42)
  * VOTE: Voted on "Should all discipline reps be made just "committee"
    members?" Results are, yes: 5  (delcypher, 21:22:50)
  * ACTION: discipline rep roles will be made into "committee members"
    (delcypher, 21:23:28)



Meeting ended at 21:28:06 UTC.
