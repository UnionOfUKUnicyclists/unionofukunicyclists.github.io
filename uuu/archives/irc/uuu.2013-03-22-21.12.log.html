<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">21:16:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Chairperson:</span> What's the deadline for paying for the hall?
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">21:16:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> one week before buc
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">21:17:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> Ok. We may need to get some of the tickets sale money from NoFitState because we are not going to enough money from other committee members
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">21:17:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SimonFlatland&gt;</span> Sorry something went really weird, back nowW
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">21:18:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SimonFlatland:</span> By the way you were supposed me not NoFitState for registration (£50 not £30) so we could have some money for the sports hall.
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">21:18:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SimonFlatland:</span> Sorry that should say "you were supposed to pay me not NoFitState..."
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">21:18:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SimonFlatland:</span> I don't think there's much we can do about it now though.
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">21:19:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> sam goodburn is now coming has he paid?
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">21:19:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> No he hasn't
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">21:20:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> ok so that should be annother 50 just have to remind him to pay you
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">21:21:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> I think last time we agreed we'd try to pay the shortfall from our own pockets so I guess we'll have to do that.
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">21:21:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SimonFlatland&gt;</span> How much is the shortfall?
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">21:21:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> well 150 if we get sam's
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">21:22:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SimonFlatland&gt;</span> I thought NoFitState said they were prepared to make a loss for this or something?
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">21:22:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> ye no probs, then if we make any money on buc the uuu can pay us back
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">21:22:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> Currently £200 shortfall. If Sam GoodBurn and James Sandercock pay them that's be down to £100
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">21:22:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> sports hall for hockey is the only cost we have at the moment
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">21:22:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SimonFlatland:</span> at the moment we are asking quite alot from them... making them front even more money seems rude
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">21:23:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SimonFlatland&gt;</span> True
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">21:23:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> Shall we just agree to do the following. Pay for the shortfall which will be between £100-£200 depending on whether or not James and/or Sam come?
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">21:24:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> guess its the only real choice
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">21:24:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> We agreed last time that Joe,Brendan, Sam and me were happy to split the short fall.
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">21:24:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Chairperson:</span> You happy with that?
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">21:24:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> agreed, we will reevaluate closer to the time at the next meeting depending on how short we are
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">21:25:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> ^ +me

<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">21:30:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jason_&gt;</span> We were hoping by running King of the Road during BUC that it would attract more attention
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">21:30:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Chairperson:</span> That's disappointing but yeah if you push the hockey players that would be great.
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">21:30:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> Edmund has registerd Lol
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">21:30:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Jason_:</span> deffinatly loving that idea
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">21:31:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Jason_:</span> Yeah it's a good idea. Just please don't have any challenges that might break anything that belongs to NoFitState.
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">21:31:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jason_&gt;</span> Hahaha, currently there are none which require breaking any property
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">21:31:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">BUC 2013 Non Unicycling events - Games, Activities, Video Competition</span>
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">21:32:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> well we already have king of the road
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">21:32:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> Cool so let's talk activities.
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">21:32:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> i'd like to run some typical slow race, WW race, type of rubbish, they are kinda fun
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">21:32:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> and good evening banter
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">21:32:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> we could also do a Wuko style drinkng tricks event?
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">21:32:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> WW rave?
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">21:32:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> WheelWalk
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">21:32:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> sorry WW race?
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">21:33:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> lol wheelWalk rave... picturing it now
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">21:33:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jason_&gt;</span> ww rave ftw
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">21:33:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> yeah that could happen too
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">21:33:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> anwyays we need to decide on a timetable
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">21:34:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> and schedule all these types of things in
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">21:34:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> What I'd like to do is collect our ideas for events and then I can make a draft timetable
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">21:34:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jason_&gt;</span> that we do
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">21:34:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SimonFlatland&gt;</span> weirdest/awkwardest trick is fun, but i think more silly things like this don't need to be planned,they just kinda happen. My worry is if we plan too many games and stuff people won't have time to socialise/ride freely. Definitely go for it though if you want to organise WW races etc etc.
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">21:34:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SimonFlatland:</span> That is a fair point.
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">21:34:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> how about a google drive doc to post ideas for events and games?
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">21:34:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> video comp relies on us having a projector which we dont have. i'm not a big fan but if people want to we need to sort it out
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">21:34:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Chairperson:</span> I think we need a timetable
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">21:35:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> more than another big suggestion list
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">21:35:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> nfs have a projector we can use
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">21:35:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> I'm happy to pull up a draft timetable. We already have the BUC2013 google calendar. I just need to update it
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">21:35:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> i think thats a great plan
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">21:35:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> I need to know the approximate length of events though.
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">21:35:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Chairperson:</span> I'm making a note of our ideas (in the agenda now)
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">21:36:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> ok, ye calende / time table good plan
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">21:36:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SimonFlatland&gt;</span> To know a time for flatland I need an idea of competitors really, but i would imagine 1-2 hours
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">21:36:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> I'll allow 2 hours
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">21:37:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SimonFlatland:</span> everyone is kinda in the same boat ;-)
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">21:37:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Jason_:</span> How long do you think we should allow for street?
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">21:37:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SimonFlatland&gt;</span> Very true
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">21:37:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jason_&gt;</span> Well, typically each round is 10 mins, so that's 30 mins of total riding. With messing around with organisation etc. I think an hour would be enough
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">21:38:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> I'm going for 1hr30mins to be on the safe side
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">21:38:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jason_&gt;</span> Good call
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">21:39:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">arfoll:</span> How long do you think we need to trials (beginners and advanced)? I'd like 2hrs for advanced, because I'm the sort of person who we keep trying a line until I physically can't do it anymore
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">21:39:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jason_&gt;</span> I think 2 hours is a good time, pretty standard I think
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">21:40:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> well i think 2hrs is unfortunately required by *some* people ;-)
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">21:40:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> but we also need a good 1hr plus for begginers
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">21:40:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Jason_:</span> There are two trials competitions though. Beginners and then advanced.
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">21:40:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> with changing, i think 4hrs
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">21:40:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">arfoll:</span> So 4hrs
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">21:40:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">21:40:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SimonFlatland&gt;</span> Will beginner lines be included in advanced too? If they were seperate then tbey could run in parallel
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">21:41:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SimonFlatland&gt;</span> But that being said resources are usually shared between the two
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">21:41:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> i would like to judge, so one way is to force competitors to judge ;-)
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">21:41:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> also like you said ressources are often shared.
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">21:41:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SimonFlatland:</span> I think the plan would be share lines.

<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">21:42:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jason_&gt;</span> Where's Gidburn?
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">21:42:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> it depends how many lines we can make, i dont see the point in all begginer lines being used, but its nice to get a good number of lines just for stamina!
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">21:42:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> Seeing as Freestyle is being made part of the show I'd like to stick freestyle on during the evening so we can be really flexible about how long it takes
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">21:42:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> depends on how many contestants 1-2hrs i guess

<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">21:47:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> What do you think a good length for a workshop is?
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">21:47:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> 1hr
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">21:47:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> half hour for trials
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">21:47:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jason_&gt;</span> Agree with 1 hour
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">21:48:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> i dont really like trials workshops anywyas
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">21:48:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> but w/e
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">21:48:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SimonFlatland&gt;</span> Agreed also
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">21:48:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> if you do a hour thats 15mins demonstration and 45min practice but you can just go wigth the flow on the day
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">21:48:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">arfoll:</span> I'd rather make the slots 1hr long. You can run a workshop for less time if you want. The workshop needs to be shorter than 1hr anyway for turnaround time
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">21:48:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> okay any other ideas for events?

<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">21:52:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> agreed
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">21:53:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> We're going to have a lot unfilled workshop slots at the moment so we should take on offers.
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">21:53:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> sure, they're f00ls and will be laughed at but they can do it

<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">21:57:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jason_&gt;</span> Pretty much. Ideally we'd need something grindable and we couldn't do that with pallettes
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">21:57:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Jason_:</span> How about pallettes covered with lube (from Brendan's workshop) ;)

<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">21:58:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> or do you need a grind box?
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">21:59:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SimonFlatland&gt;</span> Stair sets and manny pads can be made from pallets, ideally with ply wood to put on the top so it rolls well. Grind rail for the set would be ideal but i guess something to grind is better than nothing
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">21:59:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jason_&gt;</span> Both would be ideal, grind box if only one is available. It's something that could be built quite easily if we had supplies

<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">22:05:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> Trials competition is going to be the hardest to do. In the past there has been one person marking people on several lines. If we can't get enough volunteers then we may have to rethink our strategy
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">22:05:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jason_&gt;</span> I'm almost certain we'll be able to rope people in on the day to do manual labour

<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">22:06:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairperson&gt;</span> sign in
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">22:07:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jason_&gt;</span> This is why we could do with someone on the team who's organised before. I can't think of anything but I'm sure there are a hundred and one things
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">22:07:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SimonFlatland&gt;</span> I need preferably 5 judges for flatland, but i guess 3 would do. I think people who didn't say they would volunteer might judge though, kinda seems like a different thing
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">22:07:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> True, but that's only really on Friday evening when people start arriving.
