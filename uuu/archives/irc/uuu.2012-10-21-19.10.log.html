<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">19:30:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gkmac:</span> Yes it is. My plan was for people to mark in their calendars when they would be away for long periods of time and then share that calendar with the rest of the UUU so we know when committee members are going to be away.
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">19:30:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> i agree as long as not expected to put all trips &gt; 1 week in the calendar
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">19:30:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Simon____&gt;</span> Yeah we need to sort out being away. For instance the next 2 sundays I'll be in France for CFM, the French Championships
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">19:30:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iuf&gt;</span> if meeting are online it should be a problem though

<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">19:31:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">arfoll:</span> That kind of was my expectation. If you think 1 week is too short we could change that to two weeks?
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">19:32:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> two weeks away from the net? Bitch please!

<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">19:44:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Joe_____:</span> Maybe it should be "encourage" rides instead of "organise"

<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">19:45:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Joe_____&gt;</span> Reps should help groups of riders get in touch, and from that, organise rides

<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">20:10:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gkmac&gt;</span> I believe the private forum should only be used for emergencies and sensitive things. Most UUU discussion should take place in the public "Unicycling Discussion" like it always had been.

<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">20:10:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gkmac&gt;</span> I'm happy to make the forum public; it would be an alternative means of contacting the committee.
<a name="l-334"></a><span class="tm">20:10:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Chairman&gt;</span> surely emails arent about comunicating with each other its for outsiders co contact the uuu and there reps?
