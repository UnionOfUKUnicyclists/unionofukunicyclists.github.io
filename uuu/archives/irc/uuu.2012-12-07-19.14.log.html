<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:30:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> Actually thinking about it would it make more sense for us to use google docs (seeing as it's only text and links) so we can all see it and edit it together?
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:31:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SamGoodburn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Question:</span> Should we try and only use British examples for videos and pictures for these descriptions on disciplines?
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:31:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> Rather than e-mailing around our content?
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:31:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SamGoodburn:</span> i think it would be best if possible, but in some contexts - like freestyle - may not be the best idea ;-)
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:31:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SamGoodburn:</span> yes
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:31:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SamGoodburn&gt;</span> rude :P
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:32:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> <span class="hi">arfoll:</span> agreed lol may be just videos of yourself sam
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:32:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SamGoodburn:</span> My preference would be yes, but I think it's more important showcase the sport so if there's a better video of a foreign rider then use it.
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:32:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SamGoodburn&gt;</span> But yes, only using british riders for freestyle may not be practical.
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:32:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> s/not be practical/would be utter rubbish/
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:33:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SamGoodburn:</span> Agreed, just find the best videos you can regardless of the rider's nationality.
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:33:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SamGoodburn:</span> you only need one clip and you colud provide that of yourself surly? i could send you a kick up mount clip if you like ;-)
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:33:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> So what do people think about just sticking their content on google docs rather than e-mailing stuff around? yes/no?

<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">19:51:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">arfoll:</span> The membership database also records money held by committee members. This might happen because someone pays a committee member by cash for their membership.
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">19:51:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> So what is our financial state and how do we view this data base?
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">19:52:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> shall we just get the list of people who have a 'lifetime' membership and start from scratch next year?
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">19:52:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">arfoll:</span> Currently Sarah holds ~£100, Luke Ditton holds ~£40 and someone else holds a bit too. Of course this could be wrong, the money might of already been transferred but the database might not of been updated.
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">19:52:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">arfoll:</span> Very few have lifetime membership, most of the current members paid this year.
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">19:53:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> If we cant gain control of the bank acount, just start a new one?
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">19:53:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ChairmanKris:</span> I don't know our financial state. I currently have access to the database but I think the whole thing needs replacing.
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">19:53:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> ok so lets just ask sarah &amp; luke for the money (if they have not already transfered it) and start membership from BUC '13
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">19:54:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> and we'll have to deal with lifetime members by hiring contract killers
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">19:54:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> how much did a lifetime cost?
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">19:54:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BigSexyJasonAuld&gt;</span> I volunteer for the killing...
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">19:54:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BigSexyJasonAuld&gt;</span> if the money is right
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">19:54:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> If it's okay with everyone I'd like to replace the database with something new that meets are needs. I think it should really just be a membership database and finance issues should just be left with joe____ .
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">19:55:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joe____&gt;</span> thats a great idea
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">19:55:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> The membership database should also record the riders level (IUF skill levels) and who tested them...
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">19:55:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> <span class="hi">joe____:</span> do you have control of the bank account?
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">19:56:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> yes, and ok for IUF. (actually couldnt we use the forum DB to store this? And then we could have skill level as an attribute shown in the profile?)
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">19:56:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joe____&gt;</span> from the info ive had from HSBC, its a very very long winded process
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">19:56:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">joe____:</span> Wouldn't it be simpler to get Sarah to close the account and then have Joe open a new one and just transfer the money across?
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">19:56:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> <span class="hi">joe____:</span> ok is it worth doing? or should we be setting up a new account?
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">19:57:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> and whilst at it, we could link people in comp results to that db?
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">19:57:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joe____&gt;</span> with the lack of communitcation from Sarah and Luke, I think it would be easier to create a new account and start from scratch, and any existing money tranfered over
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">19:57:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> <span class="hi">joe____:</span> sounds allot simpler, we will need a account early next year
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">19:58:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">arfoll:</span> The comp results are currently a google docs spreadsheet so it wouldn't work as it is now. But if the results were stored in the SQL database then we could do it.
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">19:58:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> i know... and since you seem to have lots of time you could do something really cool ;-)

<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">20:03:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> i think having something like that could be good, requiring for 2 of us to sign for something

<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">20:32:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> i think the voodoo trophy and the hocky should be seperate from buc
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">20:32:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> One option would be to make BUC just an extra stop for the street and trials

<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">20:32:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> nah i dont think thats good - its good to have other league/comp
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">20:32:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joe____&gt;</span> sorry that was for the van comment
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">20:32:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SamGoodburn&gt;</span> I think ideally the BUC should hold the British championships. However voodoo competition are seperate for people to compete that arnt in the voodoo team like this years?
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">20:33:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> the uuu should award the british titles in my opinion
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">20:33:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> i'd rather have a one off event for BUC
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">20:33:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joe____&gt;</span> i too think it should be organised as its own competition
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">20:33:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ChairmanKris:</span> But I've treated the vooodoo street and trials league as the official 2012 and VUC as official 2011 results.
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">20:33:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> and yeah UUU should award UK titles - nothing to do with voodoo (though we'd love to use their insurance and help organising ;-))
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">20:33:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> thats ok because there was nothing else
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">20:34:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> and i believe they had permission to do it?
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">20:34:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> as in give out the 2011 titles (and maybe even 2010?)
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">20:34:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> There's no record off any permission, then again with the way the UUU used to run there isn't really a record of much...
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">20:35:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BigSexyJasonAuld&gt;</span> We will be holding the street league again, hopefully for another title and the british titles should be contested at buc
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">20:35:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> only because we werent set up to do the awards our self, in future i think uuu should hold the british champiuon ships and no one else
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">20:35:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SamGoodburn&gt;</span> Okay so regarding the BUC, I think we should put together a database of unicyclists email adresses. As one form of advertising the BUC.
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">20:36:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SamGoodburn:</span> agreed - bary gates and steve granger already have alot of emails and so does the uuu
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">20:36:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SamGoodburn&gt;</span> However,
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">20:36:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BigSexyJasonAuld&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> We did get permission from the UUU both years, we even got permission from the IUF to run it as a league format, that's a done deal.
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">20:36:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SamGoodburn&gt;</span> there are lots of unicyclists who arn't involved in forums, conventions etc
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">20:36:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> Okay. Can we all agree that the 2011 and 2012 results from Voodoo will be treated as official but next year BUC results will be considered official and seperate from the voodoo street league?
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">20:38:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BigSexyJasonAuld&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#agreed</span><span class="cmdline"></span>

<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">20:39:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> maybe we should email all the juggeling convention organisers
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">20:39:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SamGoodburn&gt;</span> going back to the email database, I think this is important because of the limited interest in BUC 2012.
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">20:39:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SamGoodburn&gt;</span> There is also lots of unicyclists who dont know about the whole scene, the forums/ conventions etc

<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">20:56:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ChairmanKris:</span> If you read through old AGMs the UUU were in the process of adopting IUF testing rules
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">20:57:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ChairmanKris:</span> but I'm not sure what happened.
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">20:57:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SamGoodburn&gt;</span> When I went to unicon I heard nothing about levels testing what so ever
<a name="l-385"></a><span class="tm">20:57:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joe____&gt;</span> sarah who?
<a name="l-386"></a><span class="tm">20:58:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;delcypher&gt;</span> I know Connie Cotter did level testing as she tested me once. I also remember her being quite interested in the UK following IUF rules rather than the UUU's
<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">20:58:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ChairmanKris&gt;</span> ahh ok because there is a list of what is required to achive a certain level, surely we could give out UUU certificates untill somof us become qualified testers
<a name="l-388"></a><span class="tm">20:58:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;arfoll&gt;</span> <span class="hi">delcypher:</span> oh yeah there was somethign weird about that... maybe worth talking to connie about it
