# Minutes of the UUU Annual General Meeting - April 23rd 2005

Minutes taken by the Secretary, Alan Chambers, and typed up by Mark Wiggins.

## Appologies

Apologies received from Richard Loxley.

## PREVIOUS MINUTES

Accepted without correction.

## CURRENT STATUS

* Membership stands at 93.
* The bank account currently contains just under Â£500.
* Levels testing has been quieter than last year with the initial rush dying
  down. It was suggested that levels posters be produced to list the skills
  required for each level. Sarah offered to design these.
* The membership database has been stable throughout the year.
* There was a question about allowing people to use the UUU website to search
  for local members. It was suggested that members be encouraged to register with
  and use the IJDb list.

Action:Ask Richard Loxley about adding information about this on the UUU website.

## MEMBERSHIP RENEWAL

To make it easier to renew UUU membership, it was proposed that the duration of
membership be changed from July-to-July to be BUC-to-BUC. This would allow UUU
Committee Members to collect monies from attendees of BUC. If there is no BUC
one year, expiry would revert back to July. In the unlikely event of several
BUCs in one year, membership would run from the first BUC of one year to the
first BUC of the next. The proposal was put to a vote and passed unanimously.

It was proposed that members should be allowed to pay for multiple years of UUU
membership. It was stated that this is already supported by the membership
database but, because of possible future price rises, this should be limited to
a maximum of 5 years.

## DIRECT BANK TRANSFER

It was proposed that members should be allowed to pay for UUU membership with
Direct Bank Transfer. It was agreed to offer this facility although vigilance
to check for fraudulent transactions will be required.

## BUC 9/10 FUND

Suggestions for uses of the BUC 9/10 Fund were once again invited. The
organisers of the South West Uni Meets have made use of a contibution to cover
insurance costs.

The Fund has also been used to pay for 3 trophies to be
awarded at BUCs:

* British Freestyle Champion
* British Trials Champion and
* British Unicycle Hockey Champions.

A debate about whether or not to allow non-British competitors to win the
trophies ensued. It was decided by a vote that, if a non-British competitor won
a competition, they would receive a certificate but the trophy would go to the
highest placed British competitor.

## REPORTS FROM THE COMMITTEE
