## 1. REVIEW OF MINUTES OF AGM 2001.

The minutes were summarised.

## 2. PROGRESS REPORTS:

### Number of members and bank balance:

* There were 61 members prior to the British Unicycling Convention. As of the AGM this had increased to 129 due to members joining at the convention.
  **(Editors note: this increased to 133 by the end of the weekend, and stands at 148 as of 7 August 2002.)**
* The bank balance was approximately Â£114.
* The secretary agreed to talk to Alan Chambers about collecting money from new member registration at the BUC.

### Website:

The website is now up in a basic form, with links to other information.

## 3. ANY ADDITIONAL ITEMS TO REPORT FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS:

### Chairperson (Sarah Miller):

Sarah confirmed we are following the proper procedures for a membership club.
She hasn't managed to get any information from the Sports regarding becoming a
sports club, partly due to access problems with the sports council staff.
Looking into how to get a Sports England accreditation mark; Roger has some
details and the chairperson will investigate.

### Secretary (Richard Loxley):

Richard is looking into created a web based membership database. This would
simplify the admin involved in maintain the membership list, and allow other
committee members access to the list.

Richard proposed we stop issuing membership cards to members who get all other
information by email. It was suggested we might be able to email a graphical
representation of the membership card for the recipient to print out.

A vote on abolishing membership cards for email members was unanimous.

### Treasurer (Paul Gibbs):

We have a moderate amount of money, which looks good, but might not go very far
if we need to spend it on anything significant.

### Newsletter editor (Claire Gibbs):

Claire made a request for article submissions.
Claire asked if PDF files are ok for email members. Most people thought so.

### IUF representative (Jon Marshall):

Jon has contacted the IUF but has received nothing back.
There is an IUF meeting at Unicon in Seattle, so we may get more information there.

## 4. DISCUSSION:

### Proposal by Steve Grainger to adopt IUF skill levels as UUU levels for an awards system.

* Proposed by Steve Grainger
* Seconded by Ray Brock
* Vote was unanimous

There was a discussion on how to appoint testers, including a tree structure of
testers recruiting and training other testers. The committee will investigate
further.

### Proposal by Sarah Miller to create honorary life members to honour outstanding contributions to UK unicycling:

* Proposed by Sarah Miller
* Seconded by Richard Loxley
* Vote was unanimous apart from one abstention.

Sarah then proposed that David Mariner be honoured as a life member, seconded by Richard Loxley, again unanimous with one abstention.

### Where are we now and where do we want to take the UUU?

We were running out of time so this discussion was shelved.

## 5. VOTING ON A UUU LOGO FROM SUBMISSIONS RECEIVED.

Five possible logos were shown.

A suggestion from the floor was made that some people might prefer a
combination of two of the logos.  Voting was by a form of single transferable
vote, with the five original logos (A, B, C, D and E) combined with the options
of F (combining B & E to use the wheel of one logo with the unicycle from the
other) and G (using logo C to form the letters UK).

### First round voting was:

* A 4 votes
* B 6 votes
* C 7 votes
* D 0 votes
* E 1 vote
* F 9 votes
* G 2 votes

A, D, E and F were eliminated.

### Second round voting:

* B 4 votes
* C 7 votes
* F 12 votes

F therefore won with a clear majority.
Danny Colyer offered to combined the two logos involved in option F.

## 6. ELECTION OF NEW COMMITTEE MEMBERS

No new candidates were forthcoming.

The existing committee members therefore offered themselves for re-election.

Sarah Miller stated that she could only stand as president for one more year.

The existing committee members were proposed by Steve Grainger and seconded by
David Mariner.  The candidates were voted in with 6 abstentions.

## 7. ANY OTHER BUSINESS

None.

## 8. ARRANGE DATE OF NEXT MEETING
