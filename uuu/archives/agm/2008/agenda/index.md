# The Annual General Meeting of the Union of UK Unicyclists to be held at the 15th British Unicycling Convention on Saturday 4 October 2008

UUU AGM 2008

## Agenda

1. Apologies
2. Review of minutes of AGM 2007.
3. Progress reports:
  * Number of members and bank balance
  * UUU levels testing
  * Hockey League
4. Proposal to buy a trophy for the UK Unicycle Hockey League:
  * This has been talked about in the past, and now that the league has run for
    a whole year it seems appropriate for the UUU to fund a trophy for the League
    Champions. A cup is proposed so as to be distinctive from the shield awarded to
    the BUC Hockey Champions.
5. Proposal to create the role of Competition Secretary:
  * The role of Competition Secretary would be to maintain the Hockey League
    webpage and to help members organise competitions in any discipline (hockey,
    trials, street, freestyle, racing, etc) outside of BUC.
6. Any additional items to report from committee members:
  * Chairperson (Paul Royle)
  * Secretary (Andy Parry)
  * Treasurer (Paul Gibbs)
  * IUF representative (Keith Griffiths)
  * Webmaster (Richard Loxley)
7. Election of committee
  * All positions are up for election each year. Specific points for this year:
    Paul Royle will step down as Chairperson; Andy Parry has stepped down as
    Secretary, Richard Loxley is happy to continue as webmaster, but would happily
    let someone else take over.
8. Any other business
Arrange date of next meeting
