# Minutes of UUU Annual Meeting - April 24th 2004

* Apologies received from Joe Rowing and Steve Grainger.
* Richard Loxley apologised for arriving late as he was having an invigorating shower.
* As Steve Grainger wasn't attending, minutes were taken by Paul Selwood

## PREVIOUS MINUTES

Accepted without correction.

## CURRENT STATUS

The number of members is about 135 - this has remained essentially constant
despite the fact that the "free" join-ups from BUCs 9 and 10 had expired.

Bank balance is Â£380 (give or take petty cash).

* Ideas for how this could be constructively spent to further unicycling in the
UK were welcomed. It was suggested that input from clubs with regard to
nominating schemes for funding would be useful.
* For reference it was noted that a paper copy of the newsletter costs about 40p
to produce and send. A levels certificate costs around 20p and frame stickers
about 50p.

Levels testing was proving very popular with about 250 certificates issued.
Clubs were encouraged to use the system if they found it helpful - new testers
could be tested and approved where required.

The membership database has been completed and is working well.

## REPORTS FROM THE COMMITTEE

Mark Wiggins repeated some of his recent message in the newsletter. The UUU is
here to promote unicycling in the UK - what more can we do? (Ideas welcome!).
Over the year he has acted as a contact point for many enquiries (including
from the media).

Mark reported that Steve Grainger has been mostly dealing with membership
issues (joiners and renewers).

Paul Gibbs noted that the treasurer's job had been made much easier by the new
web-based accounting system.

Sarah Miller had published 2 editions of "The Revolution" that she had edited
and 1 that Claire Gibbs had edited.

Joe Rowing reported (via Paul Gibbs) that he had mostly been involved with
liaison with IMBA (the International Mountain Bike Association) and was now the
UK Muni rep for IMBA. As an aside, Jon Marshall noted that the IUF have finally
approved the national representatives system.

Richard Loxley had setup the online membership database and this is working
well. Accounts are also done online and these tallied with paper versions - the
online version is now definitive. The public website was revamped with more
active maintainance of the clubs list (please tell Richard if you know of
changes!) and new information on legality of unicycling in the UK added.

## OTHER DISCUSSION

Was there any chance of getting recognition to the Sprite Urban Games? North
had attended the last one and hadn't been able to enter. He was going to try
again this year after forewarning the organisers. It was noted that any event
that welcomes/accepts unicycles could be publicised via the newsletter.

There was much discussion about what could be done to promote trials.

* Levels and grading are being actively worked on by the IUF - we should pursue
this in collaboration with them.
* There was support for future trials competitions. Insurance was thought to be a
possible issue for this, but Zurich have insured both the BUC and the Cumbrian
Muni and Trials Club for trials so they are likely to be OK with it again.
* The Isle of Man TT race had some bike trialists this year. They might be open
to suggestions for uni trials next year.

It was suggested that a list of potential funding bodies could be added to the
website. This was OK provided that those who were getting funding were happy to
share this info. It was noted that BUC 9/10 made a profit that might be used to
help events that were of benefit to large groups of people (eg underwriting
insurance for events).
