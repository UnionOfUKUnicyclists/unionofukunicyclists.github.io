                                Uni Cycles

Dear Sir, 

Thank you for you enquiry regarding the use of Uni-Cycles. The first
point that must be clarified is that by definition this type of
vehicle comes into the definition of a Pedal Cycle under Reg 3(b)
Pedal Cycle Construction and Use Regulations 1993.

Under the Highways Act 1835 Section 72 it is an offence to ride a
pedal cycle on a Foot Path, (the definition of foot path includes
pavement). This means that the vehicle should be used on the road
and not on the pavement.

With regard to brakes this type of vehicle with direct drive would
not require additional brakes.

With regard to the fitting of lights, this is dealt with under Reg 4
(3) Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989 which states, (Nothing in
these regulations shall require any lamp or reflector to be fitted
between sunrise and sunset to = Pedal Cycle). However if such a
vehicle is used between sunset and sunrise then it must be fitted
with one front position lamp one rear position lamp and one retro
reflector.

This information should help clarify the position regarding the use
of this type of vehicle on a road.

Yours sincerely

C J Bartlett PC 107. 
Traffic Management Officer.
