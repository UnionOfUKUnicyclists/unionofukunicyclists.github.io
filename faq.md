{% capture txt %} There is no one way to learn to unicycle. Some people learn by themselves,
while others may learn much quicker with someone who can already unicycle. (See the 
[club list](clubs.html)). Here are a few helpful resources.

* [Learning to ride from The Unicyclopedia](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Unicyclopedia/Learning)
* [Tutorial video from Relentless by Fate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdH0fV4Uxvk)
* [Tutorial on using a pavement/step to help you learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-xaYAkuw7Q)

If you have found a great resouce that helped you learn then please let us know.

Nearby juggling/circus skill groups are a good place to start. Check out our [clubs list](/clubs.html)
to see if there's a club near you. Unicyclists organise themselves on Facebook and there are a collection
of regional unicycling Facebook groups which advertise rides. You could also try

**Please note that this has not been written by a lawyer**.
We have attempted to pull together information written by a number of people on
the subject, but you should regard this as opinion, and if in doubt consult the
relevant legal documentation.

In 1994 the law changed, with [Statutory Instrument 1994 No. 1519: The Traffic Signs Regulations and
General Directions
1994](http://www.legislation.hmso.gov.uk/si/si1994/Uksi_19941519_en_1.htm).
In [Part 1, Section 1 (Preliminary), Item 4 (Interpretation
general)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1994/1519/regulation/4/made) it
states:

```
“pedal cycle” means a unicycle, bicycle, tricycle, or cycle having four
or more wheels, not being in any case mechanically propelled unless it is an
electrically assisted pedal cycle of such class as is to be treated as not
being a motor vehicle for the purposes of the 1984 Act.
```

With regard to using lights on unicycles, the relevant law is
[Statutory Instrument 1989 No. 1796: The Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1989/1796/contents/made).
This law includes unicycles in its regulation of lighting. It appears that unicycles are
now subject to exactly the same rules as bicycles, at least within the scope of
these documents.

It appears that some individual members of the police force are not aware of
the legal situation of unicycling.

In 2000, Mr Stuart Allbrighton was stopped by the police whilst riding a
unicycle on the road, and was told he should be riding on the pavement. He
disputed it, and wrote a letter to the Hampshire Police force (where the
incident occurred) to clarify the legal situation. He also requested
clarification over whether or not unicycles required brakes, reflectors and
lights.

A copy of the reply from Hampshire Police is available here as an
[image](assets/images/hampshirepolice.gif) or as a [text file](assets/txt/hampshirepolice.txt). The 
letter confirms that unicycles are included in the definition
of pedal cycles and thus should be ridden on the road and not on the pavement.

They do not require brakes if they have a fixed drive, as almost all unicycles
do (See [The Pedal Cycles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1983, Section 9](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1983/1176/pdfs/uksi_19831176_en.pdf)). They do not require lights and reflectors if they are ridden in the
daytime, but do require them if they are ridden at night.

This information comes from Hampshire Police, so we can probably infer that the same
logic holds in the rest of England. Since 1999 Wales has had its own system for
publishing such [Statutory Instruments](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi) as
mentioned above, so it is possible, although unlikely, that the situation is
different there. We also do not know if Scotland and Northern Ireland are any
different since they have subtly different legal systems.
