title: STFU in Stoke-on-Trent
description: A great day out in Hamsterley
---

Stoke-on-Trent was the scene for the latest [STFU](http://www.stfulondon.co.uk) ride. Although a sunny day had been requested, the driving rain and cold air upon arrival was evidence that this appeal had found no favour with the weather gods.

The ride was relocated to the dry confines of the Unit 1 Park Works, a locally-run indoor skate park. A video from the day:
