Want to take part in some friendly competition, improve your riding and smash some personal bests all at the same time?
We have been running a series of virtual distance/racing events over several weeks to test your speed and endurance. The events are running one per month until the end of the year. All you need to do is sign up, pick your distance, complete the ride on the relevant date, record it via GPS and submit a screenshot to us for verification.
Your time will be entered into our live leaderboard on our website and you will accumulate points for every race you take part in.
