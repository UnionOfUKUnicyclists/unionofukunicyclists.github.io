Want to take part in some friendly competition, improve your riding and smash some personal bests all at the same time?
We will be running a series of virtual distance/racing events over the next few weeks to test your speed and endurance. The events will run one per month until the end of the year. All you need to do is sign up, pick your distance, complete the ride on the relevant date, record it via GPS and submit a screenshot to us for verification.
Your time will be entered into a leaderboard on our website and you will accumulate points for every race you take part in. 
Full details, sign up form and rules are below.
