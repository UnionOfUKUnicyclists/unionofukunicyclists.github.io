# Learning to unicycle

Learning to unicycle takes persistence and patience, but the journey is rewarding.

We suggest following the [UUU Basic Unicycling Levels](assets/docs/basic-levels.pdf) as you learn to ride. This progression provides guidance about skills to try as you become a more versatile and coordinated rider.

When you've completed your level booklet, send it in to [levels@unicycle.org.uk](levels@unicycle.org.uk) for a certificate. We're always happy to answer questions as you learn.
