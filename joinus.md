Following the AGM of the 29th of February, there is a nominal charge of Â£5 to support the work of the UUU which is required for membership of the UUU. As a result of your membership, we will keep in touch with you about unicycling events and suggest ways of improving your unicycling. Your membership feel will support our efforts to expand the reach of unicycling and support unicycling in the UK.

When you complete the form, you will be given a link to pay for your membership with a credit or debit card.
