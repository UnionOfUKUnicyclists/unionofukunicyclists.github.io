can take on aggressive terrain. Mountain unicycles are built to take all the
abuse of a severe mountain trail.'

content='Road unicycling is about getting somewhere fast. Distances range from short sprints to long tours of hundreds of kilometers, and many people use it as a form of
transport. Road unicycling is a fantastic way to see the world.


These unicycles look different from other unicycles. Road unicycles have 
a larger wheel size to enable faster speeds. A handle may allow the rider a diversity of riding positions
 and can support bags or other equipment.'
