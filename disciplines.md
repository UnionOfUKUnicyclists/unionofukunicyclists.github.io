title='Flatland'
content='Flatland unicycling involves riders performing tricks on and around their unicycle - such as jumps, wheel flips, and spins - without
touching the ground. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cefyiEhUb8">Watch flatland unicyclists in action around London.</a>'

content='In freestyle unicycling, riders perform tricks to music, sometimes involving costumes and props. Freestyle riders 
combine unicycle skills with showmanship to entertain the audience. In 2010, Matt Sindelar entertained the 17th British Unicycle Convention
with an exemplary performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/B2X3v3JRmQc">Watch him perform here.</a>'

content="Unicycle hockey is a fast-paced game of strategy and skill. Played on 27-inch wheels with tennis balls and ice 
hockey sticks, hockey players have impressive speed and agility. Although less popular than hockey, unicyclists also play basketball 
in a similar way. For more details, find your local unicycle hockey club <a href='https://unicycle.org.uk/clubs.html'><b>here</b></a>.

content='Mountain unicycling, or muni, takes place on off-road terrain.
Muni riders move fast, like mountain bikers, on unpredictable and aggressive ground. 
Mountain unicycles are built to take all the abuse of a severe mountain trail. British 
Muni Weekends unite mountain unicyclists across the country. Watch a highlight reel from 
one of these weekends <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9KGTFtIcCU">here</a>.'

title='Road and distance'
content='Road unicycling is about getting somewhere fast. Distances range from short sprints to long tours 
of hundreds of kilometers, and many people use it as a form of transport. Road unicycling is a fantastic way to see the world.
These unicycles look different from other unicycles. Road unicycles have a larger wheel size to enable faster 
speeds. A handle may allow the rider a diversity of riding positions and can support bags or other equipment.
The National Road Race takes place annually in Horwich <a href="https://youtu.be/K3N98OpqwB0">and it looks like this</a>.'

title='Street'
content="Street unicycling is a type of unicycling that focuses on performing tricks on urban 
obstacles (e.g. curbs, ledges, stairs and hand rails). One of the UK's top street riders is Dekky Sudiarta.

title='Trials'
content='The art of negotiating a course of obstacles on a unicycle is called trials unicycling. 
Trials unicyclists use small, strongly built unicycles with knobby tyres, making big jumps, narrow 
squeezes, and precarious traverses along tight beams and rails. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XmBK1EJy48">Watch</a> 
as riders explore a trials course in Boston, Lincolnshire.'
