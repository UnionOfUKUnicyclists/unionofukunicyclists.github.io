# Freestyle skills

As you progress in unicycling, you may find that you want more challenges, and
you may want to obtain recognition for your achievements.  The International
Unicycle Federation (IUF) has created a set of 10 skill levels that unicyclists
can pass to mark their achievements as they learn to ride.  As the national
body in the UK recognised by the IUF, the UUU is able to test unicyclists and
issue level certificates.  If you wish to be tested, please contact us to find
out which events we will have an skills tester at. Or if you are a unicycle
teacher, contact us to find out about becoming a UUU tester.
