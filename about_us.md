## About the UUU

The Union of UK Unicyclists (UUU) is the organising federation for unicyclists in the UK. It was formed by a group of
unicyclists in April 2001. We work with UK unicyclists and clubs in order to:

* To promote unicycling and unicycle events throughout the UK
* To share information about unicycling and unicycle events with UK riders
* To encourage participation in all aspects of unicycling in the UK and abroad by UK riders
* To further the recognition of unicycling as a sport in the UK
